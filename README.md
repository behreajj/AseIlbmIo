# Aseprite ILBM Import and Export

## Modification

To modify these scripts, see Aseprite's [API Reference](https://github.com/aseprite/api). There is also a [type definition](https://github.com/behreajj/aseprite-type-definition) for use with VS Code and the [Lua Language Server extension](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server). I recommend a familiarity with Lua's `string.pack` and `string.unpack` methods. The formats for these methods can be found in Lua's [documentation](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.2).

 The primary source for the format specification was the [Amiga OS Wiki](https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/ILBM_IFF_Interleaved_Bitmap). Test files can be sourced from the [Amiga Graphics Archive](https://amiga.lychesis.net/) and the web site of [Walter & Werner Randelshofer](https://www.randelshofer.ch/animations/).
